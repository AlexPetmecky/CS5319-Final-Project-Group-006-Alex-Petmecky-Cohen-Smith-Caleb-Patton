Restaurant Management System 
by Alex Petmecky, Cohen Smith, Caleb Patton

Our program is implemented in the latest version of Java (JRE-21). It is a Maven project; import it as such in your Java IDE of your choice.
The repo is separated into two projects, with the top level directories "Selected" and "Unselected"
The "Selected" project contains the blackboard architecture. Import and run this project and the GUI should pop up.
The "Unselected" project contains the event-based architecture.
